The Wikipedia taxonomy is also widely used, and it is possible that the two taxonomies disagree on the classification of a species."

      "q": "Why is there no \"Reptile\" or \"Reptilia\" class in the game?",
      "a": "While some datasets, like Wikipedia, use the class Reptilia, the NCBI taxonomy does not. Instead, the NCBI taxonomy uses the class Sauropsida, which includes all reptiles and birds. This is because some of the animals commonly identified as reptiles have more in common with birds than they do with other reptiles. For example, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than they are to lizards."

    "4": {
      "q": "Why is \"domestic cat\" a possible guess but not \"domestic dog\"?",
